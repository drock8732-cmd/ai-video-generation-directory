## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Problem: Page is blank**
- Check console (F12) for errors
- Make sure all files are in same folder (index.html, script.js, styles.css)

**Problem: No styles (looks ugly)**
- Check that `styles.css` is in the same folder
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

**Problem: Features don't work**
- Check that `script.js` is in the same folder
- Check console for JavaScript errors
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

**Problem: Can't find the folder**
- Open Command Prompt
- Run: `git config --get remote.origin.url`
- This shows where your repository is

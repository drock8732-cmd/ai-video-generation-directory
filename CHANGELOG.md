## [1.0.3] - 2025-10-21

### Added
- **Pagination System for Tools Grid**
  - Previous/Next navigation buttons with gradient styling
  - Page info display showing current/total pages
  - Results counter showing visible range (e.g., "Showing 1-12 of 40 tools")
  - Automatic hiding of pagination when no results
  - Smooth scroll to top of grid when changing pages
  - Configurable items per page (default: 12 tools)

### Changed
- **Application State Enhancement**
  - Added `pagination` object to `appState` with currentPage, itemsPerPage, totalPages, totalItems
  - Modified `applyFiltersAndSearch()` to reset to page 1 when filters/search change
  - Modified `initializeApplication()` to use pagination on startup
  - Modified `selectVibe()` to reset pagination when selecting vibes

- **Filter and Search Behavior**
  - All filters now reset to page 1 for better UX
  - Vibe selection resets pagination
  - Search resets pagination
  - Prevents user confusion from being on page 5 with new filtered results

### Technical Details
- New Functions: `displayToolsWithPagination()`, `updatePaginationControls()`, `goToPreviousPage()`, `goToNextPage()`, `scrollToModelsSection()`
- Files Changed: `script.js`, `index.html`, `styles.css`
- Event Listeners: 2 new (Previous/Next button clicks)
- CSS: ~80 lines added for pagination styling with responsive design

### Benefits
- ✅ Better performance with large tool collections
- ✅ Improved user experience with clear navigation
- ✅ Responsive pagination controls (mobile-friendly)
- ✅ Professional pagination UI with disabled states
- ✅ Prevents overwhelming users with too many tools at once
- ✅ Smooth navigation with scroll-to-top feature

---

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-21

### Added
- **Input Validation System**
  - `isValidEmail()` function with regex pattern validation
  - `sanitizeSearchTerm()` function to clean and limit search input
  - Email validation in newsletter form (prevents invalid/duplicate emails)
  - Search input sanitization (100 char limit, removes special chars)

- **Error Handling Utilities**
  - `findToolById()` safe lookup function with try/catch
  - Enhanced `addToComparison()` with comprehensive error handling
  - Enhanced `updateComparisonTable()` with safe property access
  - Console warnings for debugging (non-intrusive logging)

### Changed
- **Database Schema Improvements**
  - Converted 3 popular tools to standardized complex schema
  - Runway Gen-2: Full nested structure with all metadata
  - Pika Labs: Standardized with complete objects
  - Stable Video Diffusion: Updated to match schema pattern
  - Comparison table now handles both schema types gracefully

- **Newsletter Form Enhancement**
  - Validates email format before submission
  - Checks for duplicate subscriptions
  - Clear user feedback for all validation scenarios
  - Prevents empty submissions

- **Search Handler Improvement**
  - Sanitizes search terms before processing
  - Prevents injection of problematic characters
  - Limits search term length to prevent abuse

### Fixed
- Comparison feature now handles tools with inconsistent schemas
- No crashes from missing tool properties (optional chaining)
- Graceful fallback to 'N/A' for missing data
- Better error messages for debugging

### Technical Details
- Commit: `ee180f2` - Refactored 3 tools and added validation/error handling
- Files Changed: `script.js` (+188 insertions, -77 deletions)
- Net: +111 lines (added features outweigh refactoring)
- New utility functions: 3 (isValidEmail, sanitizeSearchTerm, findToolById)
- Try/catch blocks added: 3 (comprehensive error handling)

### Benefits
- ✅ No crashes from invalid input
- ✅ Better UX with clear validation messages
- ✅ Comparison works with mixed schema types
- ✅ Foundation for full schema standardization
- ✅ More robust and production-ready code

## Rollback Guide

### To Rollback a Specific Change:

**View commits:**
```bash
git log --oneline
```

**Rollback to a specific commit:**
```bash
# Soft rollback (keeps changes, uncommits them)
git reset --soft COMMIT_HASH

# Hard rollback (discards all changes - CAREFUL!)
git reset --hard COMMIT_HASH
```

**Rollback just one file:**
```bash
git checkout COMMIT_HASH -- path/to/file
```

### Safe Rollback Examples:

**Undo Priority 1 fixes (if needed):**
```bash
git reset --hard 5a200ba  # Go back to before bug fixes
```

**Undo just the TODO.md update:**
```bash
git reset --hard 6922ac4  # Go back one commit

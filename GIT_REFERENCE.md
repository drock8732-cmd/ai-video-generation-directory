## üîÑ Quick Rollback Commands

### View What Changed in a Commit

```bash
# See what changed in a specific commit
git show COMMIT_HASH

# Examples:
git show c08a809    # See README changes
git show 6922ac4    # See bug fixes
```

### Rollback Options

#### Option 1: Soft Rollback (Keep Changes)
```bash
# Go back but keep your changes as uncommitted
git reset --soft COMMIT_HASH

# Example: Undo last commit but keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

#### Option 2: Hard Rollback (Discard Changes)
```bash
# Go back and DISCARD all changes (CAREFUL!)
git reset --hard COMMIT_HASH

# Example: Go back to before bug fixes
git reset --hard 5a200ba
```

#### Option 3: Rollback Single File
```bash
# Restore a single file from a specific commit
git checkout COMMIT_HASH -- path/to/file

# Example: Restore old README
git checkout 569879d -- README.md
```

## üéØ Common Rollback Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "I want to undo the README update"
```bash
# Option A: Soft rollback (keep changes to edit)
git reset --soft daf952f

# Option B: Just restore old README
git checkout daf952f -- README.md
```

### Scenario 2: "I want to see the code before bug fixes"
```bash
# View only (doesn't change anything)
git show 5a200ba:script.js

# Or checkout old version to a new file
git show 5a200ba:script.js > script.js.old
```

### Scenario 3: "I accidentally broke something, go back completely"
```bash
# Nuclear option - go back to specific commit
git reset --hard COMMIT_HASH

# Then force push (if already pushed)
git push --force origin your-branch-name
```

### Scenario 4: "I want to undo just the last commit"
```bash
# Keep changes, undo commit
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Discard changes, undo commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Rollback Safety Checklist

Before rolling back, ask yourself:

- [ ] Do I know which commit I want to go back to?
- [ ] Have I checked what that commit changed?
- [ ] Will rolling back break working features?
- [ ] Have I committed any current work I want to keep?
- [ ] Am I using `--soft` (safer) or `--hard` (dangerous)?
- [ ] If already pushed, do I understand force push consequences?

**Golden Rule:** Always commit your current work before rolling back!

---

## üÜò "Oh No, I Messed Up" Recovery

### If you rolled back too far:
```bash
# See all actions (including rollbacks)
git reflog

# Find the commit you want to return to
# Look for the commit hash before your rollback

# Return to it
git reset --hard COMMIT_HASH
```

### If you deleted uncommitted work:
```bash
# Unfortunately, if you used --hard and didn't commit,
# the changes are gone.
#
# Lesson: Always commit before experimenting!
```

### If you force pushed by mistake:
```bash
# Contact your team immediately
# Check GitHub to see if old commit still exists
# Restore from reflog if available
git reflog
git reset --hard COMMIT_HASH
git push --force
```

## üí° Pro Tips

**Tip 1:** Create a tag for important versions
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Version 1.0.1 - Bug fixes"
git push origin v1.0.1
```

**Tip 2:** Create a backup branch before risky operations
```bash
git branch backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# Now you can always go back to this branch
```

**Tip 3:** Use aliases for common commands
```bash
git config --global alias.undo 'reset --soft HEAD~1'
git config --global alias.last 'log -1 HEAD'

# Now you can use:
git undo   # Undo last commit
git last   # Show last commit
```

## üéì Understanding Commit Hashes

Each commit has a unique hash (like `c08a809`). This hash:
- Is generated from the commit content
- Uniquely identifies that exact state of the code
- Can be shortened (first 7 characters) for convenience
- Never changes - `c08a809` will always be the same commit

**Using hashes:**
- Full: `c08a809fc7f4c3c9f9d8e8f8f8f8f8f8f8f8f8f8`
- Short: `c08a809` (easier to type)
- Relative: `HEAD~1` (one commit before current)
- Relative: `HEAD~5` (five commits before current)
